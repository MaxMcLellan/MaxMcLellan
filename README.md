Hi, Iâ€™m Max. I'm a web developer, music nerd, and lover of all things vegan. After graduating from university with 
First Class Honours in Music Technology, I realised I wanted to find a place where tech and creativity could meet. I'm studying
with Le Wagon currently working my way towards a career in development.
